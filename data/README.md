# WMT News Crawl

We downloaded document-split versions of the English WMT News Crawl dataset. Its time period range from 2007 to 2021. As the dataset does not provide document IDs, we used [SHA256 hashes](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/pitfalls_static_language_models) of the Base64 encoded unsplit texts of articles as their IDs.
